- automatically maps Nim types to SQL types
- provides procs to query, add, delete, and update data in DB using Nim objects
- provides procs for schema migration
- allows to wrap actions in transactions that are automatically rolled back on errors
- supports reading and writing ``NULL`` values
- supports SQLite and PostgreSQL
